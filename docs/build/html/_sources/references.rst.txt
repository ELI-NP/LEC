The first results of this code were published in Ref :cite:`mypop`. The code was then extended to particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation :cite:`mypop2,mypop3`. The code in Ref. :cite:`Moritaka2013` is not for laser-beam interaction but a routine to convert gamma photon from particle to mesh is partially relevant to the present code.
