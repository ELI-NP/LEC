This code was originally written by `T. Moritaka <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Toseo_Moritaka>`_ and extended by `J. F. Ong <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jian_Fuh_Ong>`_

The first results of this code were published in Ref :cite:`mypop`. The code was then extended to particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation :cite:`mypop2,mypop3`. The code in Ref. :cite:`Moritaka2013` is not for laser-beam interaction but a routine to convert gamma photon from particle to mesh is partially relevant to the present code.
