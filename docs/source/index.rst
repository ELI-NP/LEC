Welcome to LEC's documentation!
-------------------------------

Welcome to the LEC guide. This is the documentation for LEC code, a particle code for laser-electron collision. It describes the dynamics of a relativistic electron bunch in the laser field based on Lorentz force equation. 

This documentation is prepared for users with a minimum requirement of computational  knowledge i.e. command line in unix operating system. For the user who is fluent in Fortran90 and scripting knowledge, feel free to jump to the respective sections.
